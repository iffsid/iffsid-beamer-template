Beamer template - iffsid
========================

A dark-background, high-contrast colour-scheme and template for beamer
presentations.

This theme modifies and extends
[kartikprabhu](https://github.com/kartikprabhu)'s dark beamer theme:
[Kalgan-Mule-template](https://github.com/kartikprabhu/Kalgan-Mule-template)

When the background colour interferes with some graphics that might require a
light background, the theme provides the command:

	\lightbg{}

which places a light coloured background behind the LaTeX within the braces.
